# LISA
LISA, abbreviated as Logically Interactive Software Algorithm is a rudimental voice assistant. She was built using Python 3 and is constantly being updated with new functionalities. Feel free to report any bugs or errors via email: mohnish_official@icloud.com

P.S: It is with full consiousness that I've decided not to license this software.
