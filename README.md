# Logically Interactive Software Algorithm

Logically Interactive Software Algorithm, abbreviated as LISA, is a rudimental Virtual Voice Assistant. She was built purely using Python 3. She uses Google's Speech to Text API to recognize the user's voice command. To seem somewhat on par with today's modern Voice Assistants like Siri or Alexa, she uses Google's Text to Speech (gTTS) API to turn her responses into an actual voice. She can introduce herself vis-à-vis her name, age and creation. She can fetch the current date, time and location of the user. She can play some of the user's selected songs and also do a Wikipedia Search.( Take a look at Version_Log.txt to know more).

Please keep in mind that this project is a very basic attempt at making a Voice Assistant cum Chatbot. Feel free to contact me via email (mohnish_official@icloud.com) to report any bugs or errors. I hope to improve and add more functionalities to LISA overtime.


P.S: It is with full consiousness that I've decided NOT to license this software.
